## PASCAL'S TRIANGLE
## Concept of Pascal's Triangle
- **First row** always contains a single element `1`.
- Each **subsequent row** starts and ends with `1`.
- Any **element in the middle** is the sum of the two elements above it from the previous row.


## NOTES
- Pascal's Triangle has various applications in combinatorics, algebra, and probability.
- The script is designed to handle only positive integers for n.
